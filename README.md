# Unravelling fluid-fluid properties through ML Techniques

Among the current challenges in the oil and gas industry is the control of interfacial properties in order to promote increased production from mature wells and from unconventional sources. Recently, the injection of low salinity brine has been standing out among the techniques of improved oil recovery (EOR), both for its economic and environmental appeal. In this work we investigate the relationship between structural properties of fluids and the interfacial tension of the oil/brine system. 

This study is based on post-processing of molecular dynamics simulations and data analysis using machine learning in order to extract trends and correlations. From the trajectories obtained through previous molecular dynamics simulations, we applied our own post-processing code to analyze interface order parameters, such as kurtosis of the orientation angles of molecules at the interface and in the bulk phase. Based on the ranking of the structural characteristics that most influence the interfacial tension, we noticed that among the families of molecules, the density of aromatics and paraffinic appeared in the classification list. In addition, we noticed that the system has an anisotropy, and the aromatic rings present a high ordering at the interface with a preferential orientation parallel to the plane. We also show that the interfacial tension and the width of the oil-brine interface can be represented by a linear model. 

Finally, we created two linear regression models, with an error less than 1.1 and R2 greater than 0.85, indicating that the machine learning models built were able to capture with good results the molecular dynamics information, whose data were experimentally tested, guaranteeing the quality of the results obtained.
